      summary: Constructing the Groups of a Given Order
      description: |
        The <span class="pkgname">GrpConst</span> package contains methods to
        construct up to isomorphism the groups of a given order. The
        FrattiniExtensionMethod constructs all soluble groups of a given order.
        On request it gives only those that are (or are not) nilpotent or
        supersolvable or that do (or do not) have normal Sylow subgroups for
        some given set of primes. The CyclicSplitExtensionMethod constructs all
        groups having a normal Sylow subgroup for orders of the type p^n *q. The
        method relies on the availability of a list of all groups of order p^n.
        The UpwardsExtensions algorithm takes as input a permutation group G and
        a positive integer s and returns a list of permutation groups, one for
        each extension of G by a soluble group of order a divisor of s. This
        method can used to construct the non-solvable groups of a given order by
        taking the perfect groups of certain orders as input for G. The programs
        in this package have been used to construct a large part of the Small
        Groups library.

        The <span class="pkgname">Alnuth</span> package provides various methods
        to compute with number fields which are given by a defining polynomial
        or by generators. Some of the methods provided in this package are
        written in <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> code. The other part of the
        methods is imported from the computer algebra system PARI/GP. Hence this
        package contains some <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> functions and an
        interface to some functions in the computer algebra system PARI/GP. The
        main methods included in <span class="pkgname">Alnuth</span> are:
        creating a number field, computing its maximal order (using PARI/GP),
        computing its unit group (using PARI/GP) and a presentation of this unit
        group, computing the elements of a given norm of the number field (using
        PARI/GP), determining a presentation for a finitely generated
        multiplicative subgroup (using PARI/GP), and factoring polynomials
        defined over number fields (using PARI/GP).

      summary: Computing the Automorphism Group of a p-Group
      description: |
        The <span class="pkgname">AutPGrp</span> package introduces a new
        function to compute the automorphism group of a finite $p$-group. The
        underlying algorithm is a refinement of the methods described in O'Brien
        (1995). In particular, this implementation is more efficient in both
        time and space requirements and hence has a wider range of applications
        than the ANUPQ method. Our package is written in GAP code and it makes
        use of a number of methods from the GAP library such as the MeatAxe for
        matrix groups and permutation group functions. We have compared our
        method to the others available in GAP. Our package usually out-performs
        all but the method designed for finite abelian groups. We note that our
        method uses the small groups library in certain cases and hence our
        algorithm is more effective if the small groups library is installed.

        building permutation pattern classes. Those classes are best determined
        by their basis. Both sets can be encoded by rank encoding their
        permutations. Each, the class and its basis, in their encoded form build
        a rational language. Rational languages can be easily computed by using
        automata, which also can be build directly from the token passing
        networks. Both ways will build the same language, i.e. the same
        automaton.

      description: |
        The <span class="pkgname">AClib</span> package contains a library of
        almost crystallographic groups and a some algorithms to compute with
        these groups. A group is called almost crystallographic if it is
        finitely generated nilpotent-by-finite and has no non-trivial finite
        normal subgroups. Further, an almost crystallographic group is called
        almost Bieberbach if it is torsion-free. The almost crystallographic
        groups of Hirsch length 3 and a part of the almost cyrstallographic
        groups of Hirsch length 4 have been classified by Dekimpe. This
        classification includes all almost Bieberbach groups of Hirsch lengths 3
        or 4. The AClib package gives access to this classification; that is,
        the package contains this library of groups in a computationally useful
        form. The groups in this library are available in two different
        representations. First, each of the groups of Hirsch length 3 or 4 has a
        rational matrix representation of dimension 4 or 5, respectively, and
        such representations are available in this package. Secondly, all the
        groups in this libraray are (infinite) polycyclic groups and the package
        also incorporates polycyclic presentations for them. The polycyclic
        presentations can be used to compute with the given groups using the
        methods of the Polycyclic package.

        <span class="pkgname">simpcomp</span> is a <span

        complexes. It allows the computation of many properties of simplicial
        complexes (such as the f-, g- and h-vectors, the face lattice, the
        automorphism group, (co-)homology with explicit basis computation,
        intersection form, etc.) and provides the user with functions to compute
        new complexes from old (simplex links and stars, connected sums,
        cartesian products, handle additions, bistellar flips, etc.).
        Furthermore, it comes with an extensive library of known triangulations
        of manifolds and provides the user with the possibility to create own
        complex libraries.<br /> <span class="pkgname">simpcomp</span> caches
        computed properties of a simplicial complex, thus avoiding unnecessary
        computations, internally handles the vertex labeling of the complexes
        and insures the consistency of a simplicial complex throughout all
        operations.<br /> <span class="pkgname">simpcomp</span> relies on the
        <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> package <span
        class="pkgname">homology</span> for its homology computation, but also
        provides the user with an own (co-)homology algorithm in case the

        automorphism group computation the <span class="pkgname">GAP</span>
        package <span class="pkgname">GRAPE</span> is used, which in turn uses
        the program <tt>nauty</tt> by Brendan McKay. An internal automorphism

        <span class="pkgname">Wedderga</span> is the package to compute the
        simple components of the Wedderburn decomposition of semisimple group
        algebras of finite groups over finite fields and over subfields of
        finite cyclotomic extensions of the rationals. It also contains
        functions that produce the primitive central idempotents of semisimple
        group algebras and functions for computing Schur indices. Other
        functions of <span class="pkgname">Wedderga</span> allow one to
        construct crossed products over a group with coefficients in an
        associative ring with identity and the multiplication determined by a
        given action and twisting.
